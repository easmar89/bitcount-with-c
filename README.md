# Bit Counting in C

This repository contains a C program that demonstrates the use of low-level bit operations to count the number of set bits (1s) for an unsigned integer. The purpose of this exercise is to gain a deeper understanding of bitwise operations, bit shifting, and get more familiar with the C programming language.
The program includes a series of test cases to validate the correctness of the bitcount function. The output "OK" indicates that all test cases have passed successfully.

> This is one exercise in a series of exercises aiming to learn how things work under the hood, as well as get some practice working with the C language.
